# matlab-microgrid-components
A simulation to find the optimized sizes of microgrid components (PV and battery) constrained by a certain acceptable loss of load percentage and by budget. This simulation is written by Stefano Mandelli and expanded by HÃ¥kon Duus.


## todo list (possibilities)
- [ ] optimize the minimal State of Charge of the battery, SoC_min, w.r.t. cost since SoC_min influences the battery lifetime and depends on the battery type
